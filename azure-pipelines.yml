# this file defines a set of jobs that will run when triggered on a cloned version of your repo
# a job is a set of steps
# by default, there is just one job, and you give it a list of steps

# by default, all branches get built
# but adding a trigger configuration like this says "only build master branch"
trigger:
- master

# a pool is a set of machines for running this job
# this configuration says: "use Microsoft's hosted Ubuntu Linux virtual machines"
# (we could if we wanted, have it connect to a machine WE control to run the job on)
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# the steps in the job
# scripts is one kind of step - on linux itll run in bash
# on windows itll run in command prompt
# give all steps a good display name
steps:
- script: echo Hello, world!
  displayName: Print Hello World

- script: |
    echo "Showing current directory contents"
    ls
  displayName: Show directory contents

- script: dotnet build *.sln
    workingDirectory:./PaulsUsedGoods.WebApp
  displayName: dotnet build
