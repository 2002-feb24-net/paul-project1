Moved solution 'Project1.sln' out of PaulsUsedGoods.WebApp, because it didnt belong in there, and it was causing build errors.
Initial Mapper
    Almost certainly has bugs, and causes an endless loop.
        will fix later by overloading and sending in the adding item
some tweaks in interfaces (for consistency)
some tweaks in models (for consistency and data tracking)
some tweaks in UsedGoodsDbContext
some tweaks in Item context object
    WILL NEED A NEW MIGRATION !!!!!
